 - Add writeup url(s) for each sample
 - Manage samples by tag
 - Tag autocomplete
 - VirusTotal rescan button (VirusTotal's score column)
 - Download samples from repository
 
#### Installation
- Download project by running command `git clone git@github.com:c633/malwaRE.git`
- Change line `29` of `bootstrap/start.php` to your computer hostname (on Linux or Max, you can determine your hostname using `hostname` terminal command)
- Edit `your-computer-name-here` and `your-name-here` in `app/views/index.blade.php` to whatever you want.
- Setup your environment using dot files (A dot file is basically a file that sits in the root of the project directory and contains any sensitive or environment based configuration details). For each environment you can simply create a dot file and those configuration details will be included in your code.
 -  For local environment, create a file called `.env.local.php`. This will sit in your local project directory, with the same level with `app` folder
 -  In your `.env.local.php` file you create an array of sensitive configuration details:
 ```
<?php
return array(
    'DATABASE_NAME' => 'your-database',
    'DATABASE_USER' => 'your-account',
    'DATABASE_PASSWORD' => 'your-secret-password',

    'MALWARE_STORAGE_PATH' => 'your/storage/folder/full/path/here',
    'VT_API_KEY' => 'your-virustotal-api-key',
);
 ```
- Grant the web server write permissions to the `app/storage` directories (on Linux, you can run this command `sudo chown -R www-data app/storage` to set write permissions for `apache`).
- Run migration command from your project directory: `php artisan migrate`
- Setup a Apache VirtualHosts with `DocumentRoot` point to `path/to/your/project/public/` (`public` folder is inside your project directory)
- You are done.
